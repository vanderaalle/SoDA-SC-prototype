SuperCollider modules relevant to the So.D.A. project

The SoDA project proposes the design and implementation of a sound synthesis engine in real-time for sound design, interfaced through semantic analysis with sound libraries.

The application has several goals:
- operability either in real- and non-real-time
- management of a generic multichannel audio delivery;
- integration of static and interactive audio;
- communication with other software applications.

SoDA allows to retrieve audio material from a library, to spatialize it, and to make the sound available to the user in the requested format. The term “spatialization” here and below indicates not only the definition of the sound source position in space but more generally the application of digital signal processing algorithms capable of simulating the overall influence of the  diffusion of the sound in space, such as, filtering, reverberation etc.
