NOTES:

- currently at a zone level,the filterSlope and the acoustic opacity stand affect the sound going OUT of a Zone and not IN !! 

Known BUGS: 

- readFromDisk does not work properly in both RT and NRT mode !!!!!!! (this is due to only portions of the file being cued for playback thus the buffer has to be loaded before each repetition)

Sequence/SonicSource
- BUG: if an exported score is then played back then normal play does not work anymore ! This happens becase CtkScore frees the buffer when the score has finished playing back.

- something is strange with Runner, while a score plays ok if bounce is asked again or sth like that I need to re-start the interpreter before it works again

- exportScore / play are not stable - e.g. after a commandPeriod, etc

- double check Spatialization !!!

- n_free node not found ??

- there is a synth-leak somewhere???

- it is very CPU intensive - I should somehow make everything cheaper

TO DO: 

- test with actual Ambulatory listeners

- find a way to implement acoustic opacity (alpha!)

make sure localizeSynths playback only when needed

Check Spatialization !!!

Impulse Response !

SonicSources
- UnitTests / HelpFiles

DEBUG -> SSG_AbstractSoundCloud

Runner -> master volume

SSG_AbstractListener 
- stop

SSG_AmbulatoryListenerEnv
- reset

SSG_FixedListener
- test

SSG_RandomWalker
- implement

SSG_Runner
- reset
- rest

implement SSG_SoundCloud
implement SSG_RandomWalker
test SSG_AmbulatoryListenerEnv
write the help-files for all classes
properly clean up SSG_Runner
listening radius
SSG_Runner -> perform tests so that SoundZones do not overlap inside a sonicSpace
SSG_Runner -> does not stop as expected
SSG_Runner -> check localization algorithm
SSG_AbstractListener -> check listeningRadius implementation



FINALIZE
SSG_FixedSound/SonicAtmosphere/AmbulatorySoundEnv/Func/SoundCloud
- finalize help files (copy methods, examples)
- update help files, Patterns are now supported rather than ListPattern
- finalize unit tests
