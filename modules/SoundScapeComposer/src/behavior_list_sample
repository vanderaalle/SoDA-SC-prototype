Atmo
-> relative amplitude  (0.5)

-> crossfade           (30)
-> spectral gaps ?
-> actual amplitude
-> FEUtil

Sequences
-> relative amplitude  (0.5)
-> range of movement   ([[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]])
-> speed               (0.4)   meter/sec
-> acceleration        (absolute)
-> type of Shot        (CU)
?
-> repeatable          (0)
-> size                (0.2) 

Atoms
+ sequence
-> crossfade           (to be calculated by interpreter)
-> to be associated with what other Atoms ?  (they are grouped according to relevance)
-> Frequency (ms between succesive calls)  (300) ms
-> Concatenation       (3)
