- we have to decide on the final design on the server
- 

decisions:
tags to be added -> size in meters
FEUTIL will be used to batch process everything before


to do:
- take ONLY THE FIRST RESULTS from CELI and DO not choose a random OK
- do not give priority to Atoms  OK
- put less reverb  OK
- reverb should reciprocal to spread for external spaces and analogous for internal -> add a argument of internal/external should composer
- localise sound in a greater than X distance from the listener to achieve a more dynamic lenght OK
- find out why the footsteps have been static

// FIX RANDOMNESS in Entries  OK
// Fix BUG in Atoms-bouncing  


// Fix BUG in Atoms-bouncing  
- add size in pre-process 


to report:
-> why all atoms have the same class ???



to do
-> put Spectral ANALYSIS in the PROCESS TOO
