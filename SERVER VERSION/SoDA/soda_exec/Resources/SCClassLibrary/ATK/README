The Ambisonic Toolkit (ATK) is intended to bring together a number of
tools and methods for working with Ambisonic surround sound. The intention
is for the toolset to be both ergonomic and comprehensive, providing both
classic and novel algorithms to creatively manipulate and synthesise
complex Ambisonic soundfields.

The tools are framed for the user to think in terms of the soundfield
kernel. By this, it is meant the ATK addresses the holistic problem of
creatively controlling a complete soundfield, allowing and encouraging
the composer to think beyond the placement of sounds in a sound-space
and instead attend to the impression and image of a soundfield. This
approach takes advantage of the model the Ambisonic technology presents,
and is viewed to be the idiomatic mode for working with the Ambisonic
technique.


We hope you enjoy the ATK!
